Added summary to Atom feed. Discussed CSS list spacing. Wrote script for opening current daily log entry.

## Today's Plan
- Whatever I feel like doing. It's the weekend.

## Adding summary to Atom feed

I had some trouble finding documentation for the Atom format, and the [Atom feed validator](https://validator.w3.org/feed/) seems to be down at the moment. I eventually found an example of an Atom feed that used the summary feature by going to the [Atom wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)#Example_of_an_Atom_1.0_feed). It looks like it is just `<summary>`. I added this tag to my Atom feed. It auto-generates from the page metadata for each log entry.

## Discussing yesterday's list spacing CSS

I've added the following to the [CSS Breakdown](/projects/quintens-blog/css/):

> I've created a class `.summary-directory` for use in my [Log index](/log/) so that I can give an easy-to-understand amount of spacing for my long list of entries. Previously, this list was just a list of links with default spacing, which creates [tap targets](https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/#tap-targets) which are way too close together. In order to increase the spacing of the tap targets and the legibility, I have two strategies:
>
> First, I've added summaries to each entry, and have put these on a new line below each link on the index. This (non-link) text helps create a buffer between links even with no styling. It also really helps readability to see a preview of each entry, because my date-titles are cryptic.
>
> Second, I've increased the spacing with the following CSS rule. Each entry summary, the thing being selected with `.summary-directory p` (`.summary-directory` is on the `<ul>`), gets a little space between it and its entry link, and a lot of space between it and the next entry link. This keeps it clear which link it is describing.
>
> ```css
> .summary-directory p {
>   margin-block: 0.5rem 1.5rem;
> }
> ```

## Script for opening today's log entry

I would like a script that checks the date, opens today's log entry if it exists, or generates a new one from a template if it doesn't yet. I want it to open yesterday's log entry if it's before 6am, because midnight is a very awkward time for the date to roll over.

### Resources

I have the tiniest prior experience with shell scripting, but not enough to rely on. Here, I'll collect some tutorial and reference resources I believe I might need to put this script together.

- [if..else Statement](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-if-else-statement/)
- [Get the current time and date](https://tecadmin.net/get-current-date-and-time-in-bash/)
- [Get yesterday's date](https://raspberrytips.com/display-yesterday-date-linux/) because I was a little confused from date's man page
- [Check if a file exists](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-check-if-file-exists/)
- [Appending to a file](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-append-to-file/)
- [Find and replace with sed](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-string-in-files/)
- [Using variables with sed](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/sed-substitution-variables) (I learned I needed to use double quotes)

(Most of these are from [Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/), which is a pleasant, non-bloated site. A relief from most resources you sift through on Google these days. I'll be bookmarking it.) **Edit:** Never mind! It has horribly intrusive popup video ads on mobile. Only usable with an ad-blocker, unfortunately. That's a shame, because the content was helpful!

### Someday: learn more about the shell ecosystem

I am enamored by all of these tiny, composable programs. The [date command](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html) is delightfully flexible, yet simple to use. A few months ago I stumbled upon [<cite>The Art of Unix Programming (2003)</cite>](https://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/) by Eric S. Raymond. It's a kind of socially-informed history of the UNIX design philosophy, and discusses how those little programs are interfaced. I read the introduction and I'd like to find the time to learn more someday. I think it would be very cool to learn more about why my operating system is the way it is.

### Success!

I've successfully created a wonderful script to achieve all I desire. I will need to write it up tomorrow, because it is very late now.
## Task Ideas
- Look into where else a summary should go. Do SEO-type features need me to put it somewhere in the HTML head?
- Add a subtle vertical line to block quotes, so that it's easier to tell that it's a block quote.
- Test Atom feed.
- Write about log entry script

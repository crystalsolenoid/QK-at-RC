## Release notes from [Lexaloffle](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=31341)

Introducing my first actual game on pico-8: Tile Flip! (v1.0)

Tile Flip is a puzzle game where your goal is to flip all tiles to the same color (it doesn't matter which color). You control which tile is selected with the arrow keys and press z to flip the tile, but all the 4-directionally adjacent tiles are also flipped.

Tile Flip starts out easy. On Level 1, only a single move is required to win. After winning, press z again to move onto the next level. After that, it gets harder very quickly. I can only get to Level 4 or so, but then again I'm not very good at puzzles.

Tile Flip's great grandparent is [Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)), but my exposure to this kind of puzzle was from the [minigame in Runescape](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeoneering/Puzzles#Flip_tiles).

All generated puzzles should be solvable. If you're a cheater, you can use this [solver](http://www.global-rs.com/static/lights_out_solver/solver.html).

This is my first properly polished game on pico-8, and my first attempt at composing video game music! I designed the graphics myself as well and I'm proud of the coherent asethetic and bold colors. I enjoy how pico-8 encourages me to stretch my artistic abilities. I have many years of coding under my belt, but it's hard to make nice, polished games by yourself without those art skills!

If I don't abandon this project, the next version will include a menu where you can view statistics like your current level, time playing, and moves taken. You'll also be able to retry a level (or regenerate it-- maybe this uses up lives?)

Special thanks to my girlfriend for helping me figure out how to highlight selected tiles without it looking horrible.

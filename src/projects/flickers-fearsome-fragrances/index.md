Flicker is a little spark working in their bustling shop that caters to some... curious customers. Help Flicker find everyone's favorite spooky scented candles during the midnight rush!

Special thanks to my wife for her help brainstorming the 45 fragrances. I am at my most creative when I'm laughing with you.

This game was my submission for the [Candles Bitsy Jam](https://itch.io/jam/candles-bitsy).

## Play note

The version of this game on my website is a little broken because it uses [Borksy](https://ayolland.itch.io/borksy) hacks, which I have not configured with Eleventy yet. It's perfectly playable... right up until the end! For a perfect experience, go to [itch.io](https://qazlal.itch.io/flickers-fearsome-fragrances) for now.

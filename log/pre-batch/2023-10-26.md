## Today's Plan
- **Done** Finish [Rust book ch4.4](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-04-slices.html)
- **Done** Add link to Atom feed to the log
- **Done** Lengthen whitespace in the footer

## Rust Slices

This section was much less intimidating than the previous one (on fixing ownership errors). I'm familiar with [slices in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/how-slicing-in-python-works) and MATLAB, which are much more flexible. You can go backwards, and can also skip elements (with a stride size).

Slices in Rust can not do these fancy features. Instead, they can only refer to a contiguous subsection of a data collection. I suspect this is because conceptually, Rust is working closer to the physically-adjacent memory of [the stack](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html?highlight=stack#variables-live-in-the-stack)?

I bet that Rust uses iterators for skipping and going backwards, but I've yet to learn about those in detail.

## Fat Pointers

Slices are really simple objects in Rust: just a 'fat pointer'. A fat pointer is a pointer that also has a little bit of data attached (a length, in this case). All string literals in Rust are fat pointers.

I remember learning in an intro CS class that strings in C are just `char` bytes that are adjacent in memory, and the program doesn't know when they'll end, it just keeps reading until it encounters a special character that signifies the end. That's something that can easily make you run into memory problems or unpredictable results if you aren't careful. I wonder if this is why Rust chose to bundle some pointers with metadata.

## Page Padding

I've given my navigation header and footer some breathing room by increasing the padding of the HTML element. Here's my explanation, quoted from my [CSS breakdown](/projects/quintens-blog/css/):

> Instead of having zero padding for the top and bottom, I have added a little at the top, and a lot at the bottom. This is because I was encountering some problems with my header and footer navigation being too close to the edge of the screen on mobile. Either a browser footer covers my footer, or it's too close for comfortable tapping. I don't want buttons to be too close together, because it's an unnecessary barrier for people visiting the site.

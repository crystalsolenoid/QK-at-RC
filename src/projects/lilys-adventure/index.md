summary: Unfinished Bitsy game with rich animated pixel-art fantasy world.
---

I worked on this Bitsy game during my summer robotics internship, as a surprise for my wife (then girlfriend). She is the main character, and the game is my fantastical imagination of what she and the cats might get up to while I was away.

All of the pixel art and two-frame animations are hand-made by me. It was going to have a simple [One Small Favour](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/One_Small_Favour)-style task chaining gameplay, with letters and cat treats to discover throughout. The letters will contain semi-autobiographical narrative snippets of me writing home.

I hope to turn this into something playable one day. It's a special project for me. I want to explore themes of hope, isolation, and returning home.

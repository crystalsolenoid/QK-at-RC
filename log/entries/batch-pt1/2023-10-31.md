Tried a plugin for Markdown task lists. Wasn't satisfied with output accessibility. Discussed alternative outputs.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Today's Plan
- **Done** Enable markdown checkbox lists in eleventy (haha, that went **long**)
- Write up daily log script
- Go over what else I want to do

## Markdown Checkboxes

I would like to be able to keep track of which tasks in my past Task Ideas have been completed. I think a good way to do this would be to use a markdown task list and add a link to the daily log entry of the day when I completed the task.

Eleventy's default markdown is strict to the [original markdown standard](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/basic-syntax/), so I need to modify it in order to use the task list feature. I'm going to try this tutorial on [extending eleventy markdown](https://craigofnz.github.io/posts/2023/extending-eleventy-markdown/).

I'm getting an error that markdownIt is not defined. It looks like the author of that blog didn't include the definition of that varibale. From the [official eleventy markdown doc page](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/markdown/#optional-set-your-own-library-instance), it looks like I have to require the `markdown-it` library and set it to that variable.

### Plugin Output

With that out of the way, it is now working properly. Here is the output:
```HTML
<ul class="contains-task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item">
    <input class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="" type="checkbox">
    This is a task.
  </li>
</ul>
```
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li>
<input class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="" type="checkbox">
   This is a task.
</li>
</ul>

I do not like this. It seems semantically mismatched to use an input field for a checked-off task. Even if it were properly accessible today (which I'm skeptical of), it wouldn't be very future-proof. Designers of tomorrow will not be thinking about clever edge cases when maintaining backwards compatability.

### Unicode Instead

I want something like this:

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="checked">
    &check; This is a task.
  </li>
</ul>

I'm not sure about how robust the checkmark unicode symbol would be with a screen reader. Emojis and unicode can have inintended problems on screen readers. For an example, see the "Screen Readers Do Not See What You See" section of [Blaming Screen Readers &#128681; x5](https://adrianroselli.com/2021/10/blaming-screen-readers-red-flag.html) by Adrian Roselli, which shows some examples of cryptic, annoying social media memes that use unicode symbols for decoration.

Most relevant to my decision making today is that the emoji &#128681; is not read as "red flag emoji", but as "triangular flag on post". **When unicode symbols are used in a way that doesn't match their semantic meaning, screen readers may say something completely irrelevant.**

This has motivated me to use the "check mark" unicode symbol &check; instead of the "ballot box check" &#9745;. After trying it, I do think that it's nicer looking to use unboxed checkmarks on completed tasks, and nothing on uncompleted tasks. There's less visual clutter.

### Unicode with Aria

If I really wanted the ballot box check, there are options to try. I've seen some workarounds including the example from this [article on accessible emoji in email](https://www.litmus.com/blog/special-characters-emojis-line-breaks-more-tricks-for-optimizing-your-emails-for-screen-readers):
```HTML
We <span role="img" aria-label="love">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> email!
```
which makes the heart say "love" as intended, instead of "red heart".

Another approach would be to completely hide the ballot box check from the screen reader using `aria-hidden`. The article mentioned above about emails has a great example of this:
```HTML
We <span aria-hidden="true">üëè</span>
love <span aria-hidden="true">üëè</span>
email! <span aria-hidden="true">üëè</span>
```

### Adding Redundancy with Plain Text

If applying this to my task list application, I would try something like the following:
```HTML
<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="checked">
    <span aria-hidden="true">&check;</span>
    This is a task.
    <a href=2023-10-31>Completed 2023-10-31</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a task I didn't finish.
  </li>
</ul>
```
<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="checked">
    <span aria-hidden="true">&check;</span> This is a task. <a href=2023-10-31>Completed 2023-10-31</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a task I didn't finish.
  </li>
</ul>
The checkmark will not be read aloud. However I have added a link "Completed 2023-10-31". This achieves three things:

1. Reads clearly on a screen reader, so the unicode checkmark does not need to communicate the information.
2. Could remove ambiguity for sighted readers. This is especially important for readers with [cognitive or learning disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/).
3. Is an opportunity to add additional helpful information for everyone. Having a date and a link to the post where I discuss completing the task could be very helpful for someone who wants to know how I solved a problem.

I want to keep the checkmark because it helps with skimming.

### Keeping HTML Clean with CSS `::before`

Using the CSS pseudo-object [::before](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before), it's possible to keep the checkmark entirely out of the HTML. It can be drawn before every object that has the "checked" class.

```HTML
<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="checked">
    This is a task.
    <a href=2023-10-31>Completed 2023-10-31</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a task I didn't finish.
  </li>
</ul>
```

CSS:

```CSS
.checked::before {
  content: "‚úì";
}
```

<style>.checked-test::before {content: "‚úì";}</style>
<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="checked-test">
    This is a task.
    <a href=2023-10-31>Completed 2023-10-31</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a task I didn't finish.
  </li>
</ul>

I like this solution. It is much easier to modify how I signify a completed task down the line than if I had the checkmark in the HTML.

Now I just have to figure out how to turn Markdown into this specific HTML... maybe I could modify the existing plugin? I wish I didn't have to learn how to do that, I'm busy!

## Task Ideas
- Have some sort of auto-check so that my daily log entries don't get published without an excerpt.
- Explore other [markdown-it plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:markdown-it-plugin) (slowly; I need to makes sure they don't break accessibility)
- Add word wrap to code blocks?

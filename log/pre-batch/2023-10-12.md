Today I created the very beginnings of this blog, which is generated with the static site generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). I started from scratch with the help of [11ty.Recipes](https://11ty.recipes/). I am creating it in preparation for my upcoming batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), so that it will be easy to keep a record of my time there from the very start.

## Date Woes

I got very muddled down with trying to manage the dates of these log entries in a pleasant way. I learned some about [date filters](https://11ty.rocks/eleventyjs/dates/) and [computed data](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-computed/), but got too confused to really even understand if what I want is possible.

Currently, my front matter looks like this:
```yaml
date: 2023-10-12 14:00:00-7
day: "2023-10-12"
eleventyComputed:
  title: "{{ day }}"
```
- I have to manually enter a time and timezone so that 11ty won't [think I'm talking about UTC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dates/#dates-off-by-one-day) instead of my home timezone.
- I created a custom data key `day` where I manually re-enter the date as a string. This is used for generating permalinks and the page title.
- I don't write the date in `title` directly because I might want to change how the titles are generated in the future, but don't want the permalinks to change.
- 11ty has a great variety of [options for generating the date](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dates/#setting-a-content-date-in-front-matter) of a page, but I want a date option that is both stable under modification and can be retroactive (in case I forget to write a log for a day in time, but want to write it retrospectively).

This should be possible, right?

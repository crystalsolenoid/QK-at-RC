A JavaScript calculator.

Font for the digital display is DIGITAL-7 by Sizenko Alexander. The DIGITAL-7 README with license information has been made available in this repo in the digital_7 folder.

This calculator is modeled off of the [TI-2550](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1364040), an early handheld calculator from the mid 70s with beautiful sky blue and orange accent buttons.

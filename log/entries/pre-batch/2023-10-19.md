Set up an Atom feed.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Today's Plan
- Gather resources for setting up RSS

## Setting up an Atom feed

I set up an Atom feed and [validated it](https://validator.w3.org/feed/). The Eleventy docs has a good [plugin and instructions](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/). I chose Atom instead of RSS or JSON based on an uneducated guess (and it being the default in the instructions).

I ran into a slight problem using the Eleventy plugin, because the [supplied template](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/#sample-feed-templates) doesn't specify a layout. Because of the Eleventy [data cascade](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/), the feed template then used the default layout I've assigned to the directory it's in. I suspect this might be an easy problem to run into, and the fix was really easy, so I [suggested a change to the documentation](https://github.com/11ty/11ty-website/pull/1626) to help others avoid my mistake.

I haven't really used an RSS reader since [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) (its [death](https://killedbygoogle.com/) is a formative memory of mine), so I'll have to see what the modern software offerings are in order to test this feature.
## Task Ideas
- Add project page for [Craftinatorics](craftinatorics.com)
- Add [automatic anchors for headings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orchidjs/eleventy-plugin-ids)
- Set up [excerpts](https://webbureaucrat.gitlab.io/articles/eleventy-excerpts/)
- Try some RSS readers for my growing blog bookmarks collection

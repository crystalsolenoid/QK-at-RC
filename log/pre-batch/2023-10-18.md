## Today's Plan
- **Done** Add an [About page](/about)

## About page

Just a little writing today. It's hard to write about yourself.

I had to modify my collections. Now, the main page displays a list of pages in the "home" collection. Previously, it was displaying pages in the "navigation" collection. The about page should be linked on the home page, but it isn't a navigation page of any sort.
## Task Ideas
- Decide on a specific order for home page links, and how to specify that in code. I think now it's in order of least-recently modified.
- Add a little more whitespace underneath the footer, so that links are easy to tap without hitting a back button on mobile.

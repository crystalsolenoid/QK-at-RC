summary: Exposing the information theory of my favorite little puzzle game Cows and Bulls, and those similar to it.

Back in 2018, I was in my last year of my Physics major. I was finally taking quantum mechanics. At the same time, I was on another guessing game kick. (I've always loved to program guessing games because they are entertaining, but easy to implement with just a console-based UI.) I was taking another stab at implementing the pen-and-paper game [Cows and Bulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows). This game is also known as MOO, and was very trendy with early computer users back when they were as big as rooms. Mastermind and Wordle are two other popular implementations of this game.

During this time, I discovered that the link between my favorite class and my favorite hobby was **information**, which can be measured in **bits**. I developed a suite of similar games to illustrate how much information was revealed on each turn of the game.

This [old version of Information Games](https://replit.com/@crystalsolenoid/Answers-as-Classes) is playable online and its source code readable at replit.

## I'm thinking of a number...

As a child, I remember learning about binary searches in my programming club with the guessing game "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100, and I'll tell you if your guess is higher or lower." Let's play "I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 127" so that the math is easier.

## The Author

Hey, I'm Quinten. I'm interested in:
- unexpected applications of mathematics
- Rust
- web accessibility
- self hosting
- learning how things work
- computer graphics
- hardware??
- game development under creative constraints
- fiber arts

My timeline:
1. hobby programming as a kid
2. physics and math in undergrad
3. robotics grad school
4. the Recurse Center
5. manufacturing for a neuroscience startup
6. laser operator
7. ???

Right now I listen to podcasts (tech, design, history, etc.) for 10 hours a day at work, program over SSH on my phone during my breaks, and then program and write for fun on my three-day weekends.

I live in the Pacific Northwest. My favorite bird is the green heron because it's shy, has bright orange eyes, and looks like it slouches when it flies. The first time I saw one we didn't notice each other until I was very close because it was pouring. It looked up at me from the creek with its [feathers standing straight up](https://nas-national-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/h_a1_4132_2_green-heron_barbara_houston_kk_adult.jpg) like a little dinosaur.

## This Website

I've created this website in order to encourage myself to write more about my technical misadventures. I was inspired to do so in preparation for my batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), because it seems like a good environment to start taking my writing to the next level.

My goal is to write about what I'm doing casually in the [Daily Log](/log/), and then curate a museum of my current and past projects in [Projects](/projects/). I'm still trying to figure out the writing formula that's right for me...

I've been a programmer since 2005. Over the years, I've lost a lot of really cool stuff to disc failure, obscurity, and obsolescence. Technical writing is a great way to collaborate in the present, and it can also be extremely important to the historians of the future. Even if that ends up being just my future self.

Technical details about the site can be found on its [project page](/projects/quintens-blog/).

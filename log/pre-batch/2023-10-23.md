## Today's Plan
- Add a favicon

## Linking a site icon

I've seen a lot of automatic [favicon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Favicon) generator tools online, which generate a variety of sizes for different browsers and mobile devices. I wanted something really simple: just one 16 x 16 pixel image.

I had to ignore the generators and find the [linking documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#icon) on my own. I've put the following snippet into my HTML header:

```HTML
<link rel="icon" href="styles/favicon.png" />
```

## Drawing a site icon

I used [Pyxel Edit](https://www.pyxeledit.com/) to draw my icon. I've used this paint program before when working on designing [Bitsy](https://www.bitsy.org/) games, because it has a good tile painting mode. I wanted a paint program that was simple and optimized for small color palettes.

I had no idea what to do, so I just did a hand-drawn green Q (Q for my name, green for my favorite color). A added a fun fade/trail effect to make it more visible from a distance. I think overall it looks okay.

My icon ended up being 137 bytes.

## Task Ideas
- Implement a [draft flag](https://jkc.codes/blog/creating-drafts-in-eleventy/) in Eleventy
- Refactor moving writing of different kinds into a unified writing folder, so that it doesn't get lost
